# maize_leaf_microbiota

## ABSTRACT
In natural ecosystems, microbes have developed the ability to colonize plant leaves, overcoming the harsh ecological conditions they present. However, how the microbiota that colonize the phyllosphere influences the growth of individual leaves is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the growth of Zea mays leaves in three soils with differing amounts of mineral nutrients and water and identified a leaf-growth-promoting effect driven by the leaf microbiota in a nutrient-poor soil. We built a bacterial strain collection that we used in recolonization experiments to study the microbiota mechanisms involved in leaf growth-promoting effect. We established that highly prevalent bacteria inhabiting young leaves promote individual leaf growth. Using transcriptomic analyses, we reveal a defence-related genetic network that integrates the beneficial effect of the phyllosphere microbiota into the leaf development program. We demonstrated that the individual leaf microbiota differentially represses the genetic components of the network to allow the plant to modulate the growth-defence trade-off at single-leaf resolution. Our results contribute to explaining growth promotion effect caused by the microbiota in natural soils. This knowledge can be used in agricultural settings to increase crop yields.
